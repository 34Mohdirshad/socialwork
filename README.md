📂 Project Overview

The script includes:

1. Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)

Compare two numbers and print whether a is greater, smaller, or equal to b.



2. While Loop

Prints numbers from 0 to 5.



3. For Loop with Condition

Iterates through numbers 0–5 but skips printing 3.



4. Iterating Over Strings

Prints each character of the word "mango".



5. Basic For Loops

Prints numbers from 0 to 6.

Prints multiples of 5 from 5 to 25.



6. Functions in Python

getinfo(first_name, last_name, age) → Prints formatted personal information.

sum_of_three(num1, num2, num3) → Returns the sum of three numbers.

sum_of_three(num1, num2=0, num3=0) → Demonstrates default arguments.
